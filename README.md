## Developent Story
This was my first time participating in a GameJam, and more importantly my **first time** creating a project to a strict deadline. Like all GameJams, we were given a theme we had to create a game to. This jam's theme was **Microscopic Magic**!

I decided to create a game where the player was a mage who was shrunk down to a tiny size. They had to fight skeletons using their spells to earn gold, to upgrade their stats. Once ready, they could
summon the final boss which, when defeated, would grow their size again.

Initially, my scope for the game was far too big. I wanted to add character customisation, multiple types of enemy, quests and missions, everything in the best games. I broke down the project into small tasks and added them to a Trello Board, ready to begin.

I started development and quickly realised that my scope was far too large for the project. After taking an entire day to get the enemies walking with Unity's Navmesh Agents, I knew I did not have time to finish everything I wanted to. At this point, I used an agile mindset to change the criteria of my MVP and begin working on the new goals. I frequently took short breaks to track what I had accomplished, and the next priority task to complete to ensure I stayed on track to meet deadlines.

By the end of it, I had a functioning game that was playable. Despite not having all the initial Usability Features I intended, it was a successful game and I learnt alot during the process.
